# iTerm2

> iTerm2 is a replacement for Terminal and the successor to iTerm. It works on Macs with macOS 10.10 or newer. iTerm2 brings the terminal into the modern age with features you never knew you always wanted.

## Installation

```
brew cask install iterm2
```

## Customization

### Colors

Go to `Preferences > Profiles > Colors`. Here’s where you can set up your color scheme. There are dozens you can download, just click on `Color Presets` and then Visit Online Gallery or just go to [Colorschemes](http://iterm2colorschemes.com/). Find one that you want and download it then go back to iTerm2 and back to `Color Presets` then click on `Import…` Select the theme (or themes) you want to install and open! Select which one you want from the drop-down.

### Font

Download and install the font [FiraCode](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.0.0/FiraCode.zip), install it to your system, then go back to your iTerm2 profile and go to the Text section. Here you can change your font, font size, and choose if you want the ligatures.

- Typeface: `Retina`
- Size: `14pt`

### Key Mapping

Let’s get a few extra hotkeys set up, mainly for word and line jumps (as are default in MacOS but don’t work in terminal). Let’s go to `Preferences > Profiles > Keys > Load Preset… > Natural Text Editing`
