**Console**: This is the system as a whole. This is both the command line as well as the output from previous commands.

**Command Line**: This is the actual line in a console where you type your command.

**Prompt**: This is the beginning of the command line. It usually provides some contextual information like who you are, where you are and other useful info. It typically ends in a $ . After the prompt is where you will be typing commands.

**Terminal**: This is the actual interface to the console. The program we use to interact with the console is actually a “terminal emulator”, providing us the experience of typing into an old school terminal from the convenience of our modern graphical operating system.
